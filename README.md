You may wish to re train the model or simply test your own image on the model I have already trained !

### To retrain ::
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the jupyter notebook
3. Restart the Kernel and run all

### To use your own image for testing purposes ::
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the jupyter notebook
3. Restart the Kernel and run all
4. Place your test image in the ./image directory
5. In a new cell in jupyter notebook , call the function test_image() passing the path of image as parameter
6. **Ofcourse ! Run that cell :)**
